# Here is LisaClip's readme file

* In the network folder there are several network variants, where *network_uu.py* is the structure of the model we are using
* In the loss folder, *loss.py* is where our cliploss class is located. In the init function, we can adjust the initial size and enable or disable the adaptive patch selection.
* In the tools folder, we store some scripts for data processing. Such as statistics fid-clip, plotting patch distribution, plotting loss curve, etc.
* The effect of our model is reflected in *neo_uu.py*, and we can adjust the parameters such as iteration and learning rate in this file.
